//Design patterns are used to provide a way to standardize encapsulation/calls of objects.

//The hexagonal architecture is also known as "ports and adapters" architecture. It aims at
//creating loosely coupled application components that can be easily connected to their software
//environment by means of ports and adapters. This makes components exchangeable at any level and
//facilitates test automation.
